<p>The Winnipeg chapter of Papers We Love</p>

<p>What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper. Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss in a low ego, friendly environment.</p>

<p>Papers We Love has a <strong><a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a></strong>. Please contact one of the Meetup's organizers if anyone is not following it. Be good to each other and to the PWL community!</p>

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work.

The following study critically evaluates these assumptions by conducting the attack where the assumptions do not hold.

SHANNON</p> <p><b>Published: </b>1948</p> <p><br><b>Abstract:</b></p> <p>A method is developed for representing any communication system geometrically. Messages and the corresponding signals are points in two “function spaces,” and the modulation process is a mapping of one space into the other. Using this representation, a number of results in communication theory are deduced concerning expansion and compression of bandwidth and the threshold effect. Formulas are found for the maximum rate of transmission of binary digits over a system when the signal is perturbed by various types of noise. Some of the properties of “ideal” systems which transmit at this maximum rate are discussed. The equivalent number of binary digits per second for certain information sources is calculated.</p> <p><br><b>Presenter Bio:</b></p> <p>Jay Smith is an Information Security Consultant with Online Business Systems’ Sec…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Winnipeg/events/227942585/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p><b>Title: </b>Do Artifacts Have Politics?</p> <p><b>Summary:</b> Yes.¹</p> <p><br><b>Author: </b> Langdon Winner</p> <p><b>Published: </b>Winter 1980</p> <p><br><b>Abstract:</b></p> <p>In controversies about technology and society, there is no idea more provocative than the notion that technical things have political qualities. At issue is the claim that the machines, structures, and systems of modern material culture can be accurately judged not only for their contributions of efficiency and productivity, not merely for their positive and negative environmental side effects, but also for the ways in which they can embody specific forms of power and authority. Since ideas of this kind have a persistent and troubling presence in discussions about the meaning of technology, they deserve explicit attention.</p> <p><b>Presenter Bio:</b></p> <p>Brittany Postnikoff is an undergraduate computer science student focusing on Human-Robot Interaction and security at the University of Manitoba…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Winnipeg/events/226080050/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest-neighbour indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by fi…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Winnipeg/events/221603856/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

<i>The creation of interactive worlds, such as those in video games, often include a set of computer controlled characters that must intelligently act and react in response to dynamic input from the user. These interactive behaviours usually require authors to programmatically define each behaviour, reaction, and interaction the character should take in response to user input across a range of scenarios, a process that can take significant time. While this method can successfully create robust characters, the large development overhead is not conducive to the exploration, prototyping, and testing of new character ideas.</i></p> <p><i>We designed and developed PaintBoard, a system that enables users to…</i></p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Winnipeg/events/220117454/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>
