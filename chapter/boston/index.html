<p>The Boston chapter of Papers We Love</p>

<p>What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper. Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss in a low ego, friendly environment.</p>

<p>Papers We Love has a <strong><a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a></strong>. Please contact one of the Meetup's organizers if anyone is not following it. Be good to each other and to the PWL community!</p>

          <p>Godel's Incompleteness Theorems are among the most famous results in modern mathematics.  They are often informally stated as follows:</p> <p>1. Any formal system that can express elementary arithmetic contains statements that are "true but not provable".</p> <p>2. Any consistent formal system that can express elementary arithmetic cannot prove its own consistency.</p> <p>These informal statements, however, often raise more questions than they answer.  What exactly is a "formal system"? What does it mean for a statement to be "true but not provable"?  What does it mean to "express arithmetic", and why does arithmetic have anything to do with proof or consistency?</p> <p>This talk will introduce the audience to the main ideas behind the incompleteness theorems.  We'll discuss the historical context in which the incompleteness theorems were discovered, develop the concepts necessary to properly understand what the theorems actually say, and present a sketch of the theorems' proof.</p>… <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Boston-Cambridge/events/237933920/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>"You are not expected to understand this." That is the now famous comment in UNIX v6's process switching (swtch) code. Process switching -- and multitasking more generally -- is a neat magic trick the OS pulls off. It's a delicate dance between the operating system and the hardware. We will dig into how this dance works on UNIX v6 and the PDP11, including the famous comment. We will also look into how the process switching magic happens on a more recent OS and CPU architecture (FreeBSD on x86). It should be a fun trip down the rabbit hole of operating system kernels internals and instruction set specifications</p> … <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Boston-Cambridge/events/235786123/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p><b>An oversimplified history of CSP</b></p> <p>Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) was first described by Tony Hoare in 1978.  Since then, there have been two main "branches" of further development.  In the first branch, CSP inspired how concurrency is handled in an ongoing series of programming languages — most recently (and famously) in Go.  In the second branch, CSP was refined into a rigorous "process calculus", and has since been used to formally prove various safety and liveness properties of concurrent and distributed systems.</p> <p>This talk will be a whirlwind history of CSP, a high-level overview of the process calculus, and some live demos of using a refinement checker to prove things about interesting systems.  (No proving things by hand!)</p> <p>CAR Hoare.  "<a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-3472-0_16">Communicating Sequential Processes</a>", CACM 21(8), pp. [masked], 1978.</p> <p>CAR Hoare.  <a href="http://www.usingcsp.com/"><i>Communi…</i></a></p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Boston-Cambridge/events/234829295/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Have you ever wished GUI tools for building visuals like PowerPoint and Illustrator had a more programming-like interface for making similar images rather than copying, pasting, and tweaking all the time? Have you ever wished programmatic systems like LaTeX and Processing.js allowed you to just click and drag on items in the output to change the result, rather than going through an edit-compile-run cycle every time? In some of the latest research, you can have both!</p> <p>In this talk, Jon Schuster will discuss "Programmatic and Direct Manipulation, Together at Last" [1] from this year's PLDI (Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation).
