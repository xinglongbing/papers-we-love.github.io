          <p>Next Friday, at our 13th meetup, we'll discuss a paper for which Leslie Valiant received the Turing award in 2010! The paper creates a general framework for defining learning machines and its importance for understanding what is learnable is crucial. We'll try as always to balance the mathematical aspects with the practical ones and this time we'll focus also on the philosophical impact of this great paper on the entire field of machine learning.

          <p>We are delighted to announce the first paper and meetup for our Papers We Love chapter. The event will take place at the end of the summer mainly because of planned holidays, the time needed to allow more people to find out about our new community and final organizational details. Techsociety, our new great partner, has made it possible for us to host the event at Techhub.   </p> <p>The chosen paper, "The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine", was written at Stanford by Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page to introduce Google and a nowadays established algorithm in Information Retrieval, PageRank. You can access it here, <a href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/334.pdf" class="linkified">http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/334.pdf</a> . We hope that you will enjoy reading it over the summer and come and join our discussion and presentation. </p> … <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-bucharest/events/223810198/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>
