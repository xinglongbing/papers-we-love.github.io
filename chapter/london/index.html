Kolmogorov complexity analysis suggests that we can measure how well we understand a piece of music by the concision of a program that produces it. We can then compare programmatic 'explanations' of the same piece of music via their length.<i>Meredith also sketches a way to apply his insight to psychological coding theory of perceptual organisation.

In this foundational paper, B. Liskov and S. Zilles described a concept that is now so deeply embedded into our programming ecosystem that we forget why it was even invented.

          <p>What happened in the basements of the AI lab at MIT in the late '50 is truly inspiring and this paper is telling us that story. Herbert Stoyan spent many years researching those early days and even McCarthy is pointing at his work in his papers!</p> <p><br>Lisp is one of the oldest languages out there. When I started learning about functional programming, I got interested in why Lisp languages are what they are today, what's the relationship with AI, what lambda calculus has to do with this, or why I kept hearing things like "Lisp has failed".</p> <p>Surprisingly, many concepts that we give for granted in functional programming today were there almost 60 years ago! </p> <p>The paper is quite accessible and a good start for the new season of PWL. Some Lisp sources will be presented but there is no need to have a deep knowledge of the language.

Certain papers change your life. McCarthy’s ‘Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and their Computation by Machine (Part I)’ (1960) changed mine, and so did Landin’s ‘The Next 700 Programming Languages’ (1966). And I remember the moment, halfway through my graduate career, when Guy Steele handed me Reynolds’s ‘Definitional Interpreters for Higher-Order Programming Languages’ (1972).</p> <p>It is now common to explicate the structure of a programming language by presenting an interpreter for that language. If the language interpreted is the same as the language doing the interpreting, the interpreter is called <i>meta-circular</i>. </p> <p>Interpreters may be written at differing levels of detail, to explicate different implementation strategies. For instance, the interpreter may be written in a <i>continuation-passing style</i>; or some of the higher-order …</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-London/events/231387541/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

Are you looking into this and related technologyto tackle scalability and latency reduction in a new system? </p> <p>If you are interested on an informal exchange of ideas about current trends on research and industry uses of Conflict-Free Replicated Data-Types (CRDTs), we are organizing a Get-together in central London on April 19th, starting around 17h00. Several of the initial researchers and early developers will attend, and will be open for chatting on new ideas or just help explain why a semi-lattice is cool. </p> … <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-London/events/230301525/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

Finally, a breakthrough came by sharing ideas from category theory to bring monads into functional programming, as a way to model and manage side effects. However, little has been done to ensure that entire interaction sequences <i>make sense</i>. For example, many functional programming languages will allow you to open a file handle, close it, and then try and read from it - clearly a nonsensical sequence of operations! In "Kleisli Arrows of Outrageous Fortune", Conor McBride shows us how we can borrow more ideas from the literature, introducing a new formulation of <i>indexed monads</i> - a structure with close connections to slice categories.

Many modern statistics and machine learning problems can be recast as optimization problems where we look to minimize a convex objective function.</p> <p>The resulting objective function enforces a set of desirable properties which we wish our answer to possess: a popular example would be sparsity (i.e., we wish to obtain a sparse answer for reasons of interpretability or for other reasons).</p> <p>However, it is often the case that minimizing such objective functions is difficult.

          <p><b>Equal Rights for Functional Objects, or, The More Things Change, the More they Stay the Same</b></p> <p>There are many ways of defining equality, particularly in a language which has both object-oriented and functional aspects. There's reference equality, numerical equality, shallow list equality, deep list equality, string equality, and even "fuzzy" floating-point equality. Which is the right to choose in any given situation? Which should i use for my equals() method on my custom object?</p> <p>This paper answers all of these questions, by taking a seemingly complex problem and revealing an underlying simplicity. It does this by defining one equality operation that works in any situation.</p> <p>The paper makes use of lisp syntax, but the ideas are applicable to most modern languages.</p> <p>
