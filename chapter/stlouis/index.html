Specifically, 4 improvements in ML that are not in Lisp/Scheme:</p> <p>• Pattern matching</p> <p>• Syntax more like math</p> <p>• Static typing</p> <p>• Lazy evaluation</p> <p>Craig will lead the discussion, but others are free to chime in.</p> <p><br>Thanks to Slalom for providing food at this meetup.

We will discuss the basics of relational programming, variable binding, and the strategy that µKanren uses for backtracking. We will explore these concepts using elm-microkanren[2].

          <p>In the spirit of April Fool's we'll be doing a slightly different format this month. This meeting will consist of 5 minute lightning talks on "papers I hate". The meaning of this is completely open to your own interpretation, but some possible ones could be:<br>1) papers I "hate" -- A tongue in cheek roast of a paper you really like.<br>2) "papers" I hate -- A talk on something you dislike that isn't really a paper, but is kind of one. This can be tongue in cheek or earnest.<br>3) "papers I hate" -- A paper you actually dislike, but please keep it lighthearted.</p> <p>We're removing the rule that you can't speak on a paper you published. If you want to lovingly bash your own work and think it would be fun for all then go for it. Also, if you choose to reinterpret "papers" for your talk we can also loosen the rule that the paper should be published as it would not make sense otherwise.</p> <p>I apologize for the short notice on this change in format, but if you were in the meeting…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-in-saint-louis/events/239097908/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Join us to learn about the frontier of Bayesian methods and probabilistic machine learning: Bayesian nonparametrics. We will introduce you to both the mathematical and computational aspects of the most important such model, the Chinese Restaurant Process. CRP is a fully probabilistic, generative model of clustering. First we will explore the theory and applications in both equations and plain-language graphical examples. Then we’ll tell you our story of woe and ultimate triumph in translating this powerful paper into software for big data through 7 rounds of performance optimization rewrites in Scala. Even if you’re not using CRP, these time-honored strategies for speeding up complex calculations will help you unleash your statistical models on big data.</p> <p>Cibo Technologies is a Computational Agronomy startup using daily, planetary-scale agricultural models to improve farms, commodity trading and global supply chains.

          <p>A homomorphic encryption scheme is one that allows computations to be carried out on ciphertext.  The idea is the following: I have two integers a and b and I want to encrypt them in a special way, one that allows YOU to use ENCRYPT(a) and ENCRYPT(b) to compute a third value x such that DECRYPT(x) = a+b - in other words, you have computed a+b for me and I didn't even have to tell you what a or b were!  Such a scheme would have a great many applications but the quest to construct one was mostly fruitless until just a few years ago.</p> <p>In my talk, I'll start by explaining what a homomorphic encryption is, why the "fully" in my title is an important qualifier, and go into a few of the many reasons that homomorphic encryption is a big deal.  I will then talk a bit about recent progress in this area with specific focus on the  (linked) papers <a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2009/616.pdf">Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Integers</a> and </p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-in-saint-louis/events/237047272/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>This month, programming goddess[1] Jessica Kerr will present on "Using Reasoning About Knowledge to Analyze Distributed Systems" by Joseph Y. Halpern. A link to the paper can be found here: <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/halpern/papers/UsingRAK.pdf" class="linkified">https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/halpern/papers/UsingRAK.pdf</a></p> <p>Here's a taste of the paper from its introduction: "Designing, understanding, and reasoning about distributed systems can be complicated. The major complexities arise from the uncertainties inherent in the system, particularly with regard to message delivery and possible faulty or unexpected behavior of processors. A protocol must be designed (and proved!) to function correctly even if it is possible for messages to be lost, for messages to arrive out of order, or for some processor to fail."</p> <p>Please note that we're at a new location this month: Ultralinq will be hosting us at 9666 Olive Blvd. in Olivette.

We'll discuss what the meaning of "essence" and "accident" in software engineering, and where we should focus our efforts for maximum impact as we design and build software.</p> … <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-in-saint-louis/events/232754926/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Arrow's impossibility theorem is the original, seminal example of a "voting paradox" that limits how "nicely" a method of producing a group decision from individual preferences (like voting) can behave.  Specifically, the theorem describes 4 properties that we'd all like our voting system to have and states that no voting system can have all these properties at once.</p> <p>The beauty of the theorem is how easily it can be tied to common frustrations of democratic politics.  I will start by giving a few historical examples of the independence of irrelevant alternatives (the most interesting of the aforementioned 4 properties) in action.  I will then give a simplified toy proof of the theorem posed via a game in which one voter does their best to troll another.  Finally, I will blast off into outer space and discuss esoteric and impractical topics like set theory and ultrafilter voting.   </p> <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem">Wikipedia ar…</a></p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-in-saint-louis/events/230831412/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>This will start with a brief introduction to differential expression analysis. This is the approach of comparing gene expression in two or more tissue samples to compare the way genes are expressed in various conditions. This will cover the basic principle, caveats, and a couple different approaches. </p> <p><br>The second part will focus on one particular method for expression analysis, as developed by the Pachter Lab at UC Berkeley. They have used a newer method of assigning RNA-Seq reads to the correct locations of the genome. The RNA-Seq quantification is handled by the program kallisto, and the differential expression is performed by sleuth.</p> <p>Web Pages for the tools:</p> <p><a href="http://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/about.html"></a><a href="http://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/about.htm" class="linkified">http://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/about.htm</a>l</p> <p><br><a href="http://pachterlab.github.io/sleuth/about.html"></a></p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-in-saint-louis/events/226155831/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Excerpt from Kevin:</p> <p>Yes the title sounds all biologyish-chemistryish but it's really a theoretical biology paper, which mostly means building fairly simple mathematical models of physical processes (with some numerical simulations). Parts of it are mathematically challenging but those parts can be glossed over without missing much.</p> <p>If you look at the paper and it's too scary, don't worry. I'll do my best to explain what I love about this paper, but maybe you can read this 2-page review?
