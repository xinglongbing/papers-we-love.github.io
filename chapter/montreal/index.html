He wrote me a nice list of the papers and comments which I will reproduce exactly (modulo meetup.com's strange formatting):</p> <p><br>1.

Java JITs, JavaScript JITs, etc. It's still very relevant to JIT compiler design, but it's something you may not learn about in a compiler class. The technique was pioneered in Self, but I thought this paper is best, because the Self paper introducing it also introduces a half-dozen other optimizations, which would just confuse the discussion."</p> <p>I am very excited about having an interesting compiler paper presented at PWLMTL, and I'm sure all you compiler design afficionados will enjoy this one.  For those who don't think they're interested in compilers, consider how insight into JIT optimizations can help you reason about the performance o…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Montreal/events/223605623/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

Given the length of the first paper, I recommend reading Krizhevsky's paper in detail, and skimming LeCun's paper as needed for background.</p> <p>


Everyone interested in machine learning, image processing and recognition, or GPU computing should come!</p> <p>
