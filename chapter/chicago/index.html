The SWIM protocol addresses severe limitations in the scalability of existing heartbeat-based broadcast membership algorithms by introducing a new approach using weakly-consistent, gossip based information sharing. </p> <p>We'll start by working to understand the general problem space of group membership.

          <p><b>The Paper:<br></b>A description of 北斎 Hokusai, a real time system which is able to capture frequency information for streams of arbitrary sequences of symbols. The algorithm uses the CountMin sketch as its basis and exploits the fact that sketching is linear. It provides real time statistics of arbitrary events, e.g. streams of queries as a function of time. We use a factorizing approximation to provide point estimates at arbitrary (time, item) combinations. Queries can be answered in constant time.</p> <p><a href="http://www.auai.org/uai2012/papers/231.pdf"></a><a href="http://www.auai.org/uai2012/papers/231.pdf" class="linkified">http://www.auai.org/uai2012/papers/231.pdf</a></p> <p>

          <p><b>The Paper: <br></b>Naive Bayes classifiers are based upon Bayes theorem, a probability and stats theory that relates current probability to prior probability. A central assumption of the Naive Bayes classifier is the assumption that each predictor, or piece of evidence observed, is independent of other predictors. Given this simplicity (the 'naive' assumption) Naive Bayes classifiers have been shown to outperform other more sophisticated classifiers. We'll review what types of data attributes Rish argues can impact the performance of Naive Bayes as well as review an implementation in Python I wrote.</p> <p><a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~isbell/reading/papers/Rish.pdf"></a><a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~isbell/reading/papers/Rish.pdf" class="linkified">http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~isbell/reading/papers/Rish.pdf</a></p> <p><br><b>The Speaker:</b><br>Given that Lorena was a policy analyst what is the likelihood that yes she would want to learn about modeling data?

          <p><b>The Paper:</b></p> <p>The probabilistic test for primality presented in Michael Rabin's 1977 paper is interesting because prime numbers are at the center of several high-profile algorithm problems, and because probabilistic "proofs" in general challenge naive notions of mathematical certainty.

He reveals a forgotten class of grammars-- top-down parsing language (TDPL), and some extensions known as parsing-expression grammars (PEGS) -- that directly correspond to the parsers that implement them. His primary contribution, however, is applying modern functional programming techniques of laziness and algebraic data structures to make TDPL/PEG parsers computationally efficient.</p> <p>The paper can be found here: <a href="http://bford.info/pub/lang/thesis.pdf"></a><a href="http://bford.info/pub/lang/thesis.pdf" class="linkified">http://bford.info/pub/lang/thesis.pdf</a></p> <p><b>About our speaker:</b></p> <p>Sean Cribbs is a Software Engineer at Basho Technologies, where he has contributed to many aspects of Riak, the distributed …</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Chicago/events/196391192/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>
