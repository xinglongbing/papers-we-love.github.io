          <p>We will be talking about Peter Bailis' 2015 paper "Feral Concurrency Control.</p> <p><br><b>Abstract</b></p> <p>The rise of data-intensive “Web 2.0” Internet services has led to a range of popular new programming frameworks that collectively embody the latest incarnation of the vision of Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) systems, albeit at unprecedented scale. In this work, we empirically investigate modern ORM-backed applications’ use and disuse of database concurrency control mechanisms. Specifically, we focus our study on the common use of feral, or application-level, mechanisms for maintaining database integrity, which, across a range of ORM systems, often take the form of declarative correctness criteria, or invariants. We quantitatively analyze the use of these mechanisms in a range of open source applications written using the Ruby on Rails ORM and find that feral invariants are the most popular means of ensuring integrity (and, by usage, are over 37 times more popular than tr…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/240921517/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

Explaining the Predictions of Any Classifier</a>.</p> <p>"Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust in a model. Trust is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether or not to deploy a new model. Such understanding further provides insights into the model, which can be used to turn an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction."</p> <p><br><b>Round Two</b></p> <p>Andrew Beyer presents &lt;…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/240572865/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

Language modularity refers to the ability to combine independently developed languages without changing their respective definitions. A language is not anymore a fixed quantity, instead it can be extended with domain-specific constructs as needed. Projectional editing refers to a technique of building editors and IDEs that avoid the need for parsers. They support a wide range of tightly integrated notations including textual, symbolic, tabular and graphical. In addition, by avoiding parsers, the well-known limitations of grammar composition are avoided as well."</p> <p><b>David Graunke presents <a href="http://matt.might.net/papers/might2011derivatives.pdf">Parsing with Derivatives</a>…</b></p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/239026973/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Error rates across one of Facebook’s sites were spiking. The problem had first shown up through an automated alert triggered by an in-memory time-series database called Gorilla a few minutes after the problem started. One set of engineers mitigated the immediate issue. A second group set out to find the root cause. They fired up Facebook’s time series correlation engine built on top of Gorilla, and searched for metrics showing a correlation with the errors. This showed that copying a release binary to Facebook’s web servers (a routine event) caused an anomalous drop in memory used across the site</p> <p>Open source version: <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/beringei" class="linkified">https://github.com/facebookincubator/beringei</a></p> <p>Lazy people paper summary: <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/blog.acolyer.org/2016/05/03/gorilla-a-fast-scalable-in-memory-time-series-database/amp/" class="linkified">https://www.google.com/amp/s/blog.acolyer.org/2016/05/03/goril…</a></p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/237408130/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

New Directions in Cryptography introduced the idea of digital signatures and public key cryptosystems, and reduced both problems to the search for a trap-door one-way permutation. Although Diffie and Hellman were unable to come up with such a permutation (settling for "just" Diffie-Hellman-Merkle key exchange), they laid the theoretical framework and invited others to join the search. Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman read the paper, did a lot of hard thinking, and a year later published A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-Key Cryptosystems - now known as the RSA algorithm.</p> <p>David works on Infrastructure Security for Salesforce.com.</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/235992744/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

However, similar abstractions do not exist for storing and accessing metadata. To fill this gap, Tango provides developers with the abstraction of a replicated, in-memory data structure (such as a map or a tree) backed by a shared log. Tango objects are easy to build and use, replicating state via simple append and read operations on the shared log instead of complex distributed protocols; in the process, they obtain properties such as linearizability, persistence and high availability from the shared log. Tango also leverages the shared log to enable fast transactions across different objects, allowing applications to partition state across m…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/232475084/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Many prior efforts have suggested that Internet video Quality of Experience (QoE) could be dramatically improved by using data-driven prediction of video quality for different choices (e.g., CDN or bitrate) to make optimal decisions. However, building such a prediction system is challenging on two fronts. First, the relationships between video quality and observed session features can be quite complex. Second, video quality changes dynamically. Thus, we need a prediction model that is (a) expressive enough to capture these complex relationships and (b) capable of updating quality predictions in near real-time. Unfortunately, several seemingly natural solutions (e.g., simple machine learning approaches and simple network models) fail on one or more fronts. Thus, the potential benefits promised by these prior efforts remain unrealized. We address these challenges and present the design and implementation of Critical Feature Analytics (CFA). The design of CFA is driven by domain-specif…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/230398379/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

This paper presents Chord, a distributed lookup protocol that addresses this problem. Chord provides support for just one operation: given a key, it maps the key onto a node. Data location can be easily implemented on top of Chord by associating a key with each data item, and storing the key/data item pair at the node to which the key maps. Chord adapts efficiently as nodes join and leave the system, and can answer queries even if the system is continuously changing. Results from theoretical analysis, simulations, and ex- periments show that Chord is scalable, with communication cost and the state maintained by each node scaling logarithmically with the number of Chord nodes."</p> <p></p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/227211670/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Trevor Lalish-Menagh will present "A Critique of the CAP Theorem." Abstract:</p> <p>The CAP Theorem is a frequently cited impossibility result in distributed systems, especially among NoSQL distributed databases. In this paper we survey some of the confusion about the meaning of CAP, including inconsistencies and ambiguities in its definitions, and we highlight some problems in its formalization. CAP is often interpreted as proof that eventually consistent databases have better availability properties than strongly consistent databases; although there is some truth in this, we show that more careful reasoning is required. These problems cast doubt on the utility of CAP as a tool for reasoning about trade-offs in practical systems. As alternative to CAP, we propose a "delay-sensitivity" framework, which analyzes the sensitivity of operation latency to network delay, and which may help practitioners reason about the trade-offs between consistency guarantees and tolerance of network fa…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/226493450/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p><b>Abstract</b></p> <p>We present Mesos, a platform for sharing commodity clusters between multiple diverse cluster computing frameworks, such as Hadoop and MPI. Sharing improves cluster utilization and avoids per-framework data replication. Mesos shares resources in a fine-grained manner, allowing frameworks to achieve data locality by taking turns reading data stored on each machine. To support the sophisticated schedulers of today's frameworks, Mesos introduces a distributed two-level scheduling mechanism called resource offers. Mesos decides how many resources to offer each framework, while frameworks decide which resources to accept and which computations to run on them. Our results show that Mesos can achieve near-optimal data locality when sharing the cluster among diverse frameworks, can scale to 50,000 (emulated) nodes, and is resilient to failures.</p> <p><b><br></b></p> <p><b>Presenter:</b></p> <p>Ankur Chauhan</p> <p><b>Links:</b></p> <p></p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/224064458/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Derek Elkins will present on "Dedalus: Datalog in Time and Space" touching also on some follow-on work.</p> <p><b>Abstract. </b></p> <p>Recent research has explored using Datalog-based languages to express a distributed system as a set of logical invariants. Two properties of distributed systems proved difficult to model in Datalog. First, the state of any such system evolves with its execution. Second, deductions in these systems may be arbitrarily delayed, dropped, or reordered by the unreliable network links they must traverse. Previous efforts addressed the former by extending Datalog to include updates, key constraints, persistence and events, and the latter by assuming ordered and reliable delivery while ignoring delay. These details have a semantics outside Datalog, which increases the complexity of the language and its interpretation, and forces programmers to think operationally. We argue that the missing component from these previous languages is a notion of time.</p> <p>I…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/223224228/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

<b>Abstract</b></p> <p>





Bigtable is a distributed storage system for managing structured data that is designed to scale to a very large size: petabytes of data across thousands of commodity servers. Many projects at Google store data in Bigtable, including web indexing, Google Earth, and Google Finance. These applications place very different demands on Bigtable, both in terms of data size (from URLs to web pages to satellite imagery) and latency requirements (from backend bulk processing to real-time data serving). Despite these varied demands, Bigtable has successfully provided a flexible, high-performance solution for all of these Google products. In this paper we describe the simple data model provided by Bigtable, which gives clients dynamic control over data layout and format, and we describe the design and implementation of Bigtable.</p> <p>

The common implementation is based on wide trees with a fixed number of children per node, which allows fast indexed lookup and update operations. In this paper, the authors extend the vector data type with a new underlying data structure, Relaxed Radix Balanced Trees (RRB-Trees), and show how this structure allows immutable vector concatenation, insert-at and splits in O(logN) time while maintaining the index, update and iteration speeds of the original vector data structure.</p> <p><br>Chris Bilson will be presenting this paper followed by a Q&amp;A session.</p> <p>Link: &lt;a&gt;RRB-Trees: Efficient Immutable Vectors&lt;/a&gt;</p> … <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/209319592/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>
