<p>What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research publication with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper. Otherwise, just come, listen, learn, and discuss.</p>

<p>We'll be using <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love">papers-we-love's curated repository</a>. Please contribute by adding PR's for papers, code, and/or links to other repositories.</p>

The author applies the topological mantra that a compact set is a set that "behaves like" a finite set to the setting of programming, constructing a class of infinite data structures that have finite-time exhaustive search algorithms.</p> <p>We seek to present all topics thoroughly while assuming as little background as possible.

Remember to tell us who wrote it and why you like it! As time allows, you can present more than one. If you're not sure where to find a paper to read, reach out to me and I can point you in the right direction.  Feel free to comment on the event if you're concerned others might cover the same paper.</p> <p>We're still going to have food and drinks and the usual timeline.</p> … <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-LA/events/233476568/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

Software has traditionally been constructed according to the principle that a module should expose its functionality but hide its implementation.

However, in some cases black-box abstraction causes the very problems it is supposed to eliminate.</p> <p>As a programming languages becomes higher and higher level, its implementation in terms of the underlying machines involves more and more trade-offs on the part of the implementer, about what cases to optimize at the expense of other cases.
